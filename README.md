# PUQFFAL!!!
A series of story-based games I've made with Ren'Py, a visual novel engine.

Each of these are to be played in chronological order of when I made them:
1. Pippy's Ultimate Quest for Friendship (and Lessons)!!!
2. Myx's Bittersweet Musings
3. OPTIONAL DEMO (then again, everything is optional): ( Sweetly Sweetened Sweets )
