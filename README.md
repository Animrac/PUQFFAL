# Visual Novels
A series of story-based games I've made with Ren'Py, a visual novel engine.

Each of these are to be played in chronological order of when I made them:
> Pippy's Ultimate Quest for Friendship (and Lessons)!!!
> Myx's Bittersweet Musings
> OPTIONAL DEMO (then again, everything is optional): ( Sweetly Sweetened Sweets )

To play them on your web browser, please head over to: https://mintglow.itch.io/
